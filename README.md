# Experimentalism and Politics in Early 20th-Century American Music

## Course Module Overview

This open‑source digital humanities project provides a three‑week undergraduate module exploring the intersection of musical innovation, social consciousness, and political engagement in the United States during the early 20th century. The module focuses on three pivotal nodes of American experimentalism:

* **Charles Ives** – insurance executive and composer whose radical polytonality, collage‑like quotations, and transcendentalist outlook challenged the European concert tradition.
* **Henry Cowell** – inventor of “tone clusters,” proponent of ultra‑modernism, and a key mentor to the next generation of American experimentalists.
* **The Composers’ Collective of New York** – a left‑wing group of composers who sought to create a “people’s music” for the labor movement and the political struggles of the 1930s.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:

1. Identify the core musical techniques (polytonality, tone clusters, quotation, folk‑song arrangement) developed by Ives, Cowell, and the Composers’ Collective.
2. Explain how each figure or collective used musical innovation to express social, political, or philosophical ideas.
3. Analyze primary‑source documents (manifestos, essays, letters) to reconstruct the debates about the role of music in American society.
4. Connect early‑20th‑century experimental practices to later developments in American avant‑garde and protest music.

## Repository Structure

* `syllabus.md` – a week‑by‑week outline of topics, readings, and listening.
* `composer‑profiles/` – detailed biographical and analytical notes on Ives, Cowell, and the Composers’ Collective.
* `primary‑sources/` – (planned) excerpts from writings and manifestos with guided questions.
* `listening/` – (planned) links to public‑domain recordings of key works.
