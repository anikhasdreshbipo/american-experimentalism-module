## Week 1: Charles Ives and the American Transcendentalist Tradition

### Main Topic
Ives’s dual career as insurance executive and composer; his use of polytonality, collage‑like quotation, and musical “collisions” to express a uniquely American transcendentalist philosophy.

### Required Readings
1. **Ives, Charles.** *Essays Before a Sonata* (excerpts) – “The Unanswered Question” and “Emerson.”
2. **Burkholder, J. Peter.** “Charles Ives and the Meaning of Quotation.” *Musical Quarterly* 73, no. 2 (1989): 195–223.
3. **Swafford, Jan.** *Charles Ives: A Life with Music* (Norton, 1996), chapters 4–6.

### Key Musical Works
* *The Unanswered Question* (1908)
* *Three Places in New England* (1911–1914)
* *Piano Sonata No. 2, “Concord, Mass., 1840–1860”* (1915)
* *Central Park in the Dark* (1906)

### Discussion Questions
1. How does Ives’s layering of independent musical lines mirror the pluralistic, democratic society he envisioned?
2. In what ways does Ives’s music “quote” or transform vernacular American tunes (hymns, marches, folk songs)? What is the effect of these quotations?
3. Can Ives’s insurance‑business career be seen as a parallel to his compositional practice? Why or why not?

## Week 2: Henry Cowell, “Tone Clusters,” and Ultramodernism

### Main Topic
Cowell’s invention of new piano techniques (tone clusters, string‑plucking, fist‑and‑forearm clusters); his role as a propagandist for the “ultra‑modern” movement; and his cross‑cultural explorations of non‑Western musics.

### Required Readings
1. **Cowell, Henry.** *New Musical Resources* (1930), chapters 3–5 (“Tone Clusters,” “Rhythm,” “Dissonance”).
2. **Hicks, Michael.** “Henry Cowell’s ‘Ultra‑Modernism’ and the Politics of the Avant‑Garde.” *American Music* 12, no. 3 (1994): 279–301.
3. **Mead, Rita.** *Henry Cowell’s New Music, 1925–1936: The Society, the Music Editions, and the Recordings* (UMI Research Press, 1981), pp. 45–78.

### Key Musical Works
* *The Tides of Manaunaun* (1917)
* *Aeolian Harp* (1923)
* *The Banshee* (1925)
* *Quartet Romantic* (1915–1917)
* *United Quartet* (1936)

### Discussion Questions
1. Cowell called tone clusters “secundal harmony.” How does this terminology reframe dissonance as a constructive, rather than disruptive, element?
2. What political or social values did Cowell associate with “ultra‑modernism”? How did he promote these values through his writings and the *New Music* edition?
3. In what ways did Cowell’s interest in world musics (Irish, Japanese, Persian) anticipate later 20th‑century trends in “global” composition?

## Week 3: The Composers’ Collective of New York: Music, Protest, and the Labor Movement

### Main Topic
The formation, goals, and legacy of the Composers’ Collective (1932–1936); the tension between “art music” and “mass song”; the role of music in left‑wing political organizing during the Great Depression.

### Required Readings
1. **Reuss, Richard A.** “The Composers’ Collective of New York, 1932–1936.” *American Music* 3, no. 3 (1985): 281–303.
2. **Denisoff, R. Serge.** “The Proletarian Renaissance: The New York Composers’ Collective and the Popular Front.” In *Great Day Coming: Folk Music and the American Left* (University of Illinois Press, 1971), pp. 56–82.
3. **Seeger, Ruth Crawford.** “The Music of the American Worker” (1934), reprinted in *Ruth Crawford Seeger: A Composer’s Search for American Music*, ed. Judith Tick (Oxford, 1997), pp. 210–225.

### Key Musical Works
* **Marc Blitzstein** – *The Cradle Will Rock* (excerpts)
* **Earl Robinson** – *Joe Hill* (1936)
* **Ruth Crawford Seeger** – *Chinaman, Laundryman* (1932)
* **Elie Siegmeister** – *Strange Funeral in Braddock* (1933)
* Collective anthologies: *Workers Song Book 1* (1934), *Songs of the People* (1935)

### Discussion Questions
1. How did the Composers’ Collective define “people’s music”? In what ways did they try to make “high‑art” techniques accessible to a working‑class audience?
2. Compare the musical style of a Collective song (e.g., *Joe Hill*) with a contemporaneous popular or folk song. What compositional choices mark it as “art music”?
3. Why did the Collective disband in the late 1930s? What historical shifts (the Popular Front, the rise of commercial folk music, etc.) contributed to its dissolution?
